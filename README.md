# Features:
### All users are able to (users can simultaneously be clients and agents):
- [x] Register a new account.
- [x] Login and Logout.
- [x] Edit their profile (at least name, username, password, and e-mail).

### Clients are able to:

- [x] Submit a new ticket optionally choosing a department (e.g., "Accounting").
- [x] List and track tickets they have submitted.
- [x] Reply to inquiries (e.g., the agent asks for more details) about their tickets and add more information to already submitted tickets.

### Agents are able to (they are also clients):

- [x] List tickets from their departments (e.g., "Accounting"), and filter them in different ways (e.g., by date, by assigned agent, by status, by priority, by hashtag).
- [x] Change the department of a ticket (e.g., the client chose the wrong department).
- [x] Assign a ticket to themselves or someone else.
